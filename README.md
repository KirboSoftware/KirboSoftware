# Welcome to my github repository ðŸ‘‹

I'm Joost aka JoostMSoftware, I'm from the netherlands and I'm a software developer (student). I make web applications and minecraft mods

## What do I code in?

I code in the following languages.
- HTML/CSS/JS
- php
- Java
- Rust
- Zig
- C++/C#

## What do I do?

I'm mostly a Minecraft modder, I use the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) modloader the most as it's easy to learn, easy to understand and rather supportive with third party dependencies. I also work with the Svelte javascript framework for my webdevelopment and rust for my API.
